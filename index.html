<a id="the-rules" class="anchor" href="#the-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Rules</h3>
                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/cwmma">Calvin</a>â€™s bingo is a game where you get a paper sheet with a printed grid filled with words that are related to the conference. The idea is to mark off a word within the grid when it is used in a
                    talk or Q&A at the conference. Once you have marked off all the words in a row or column you have reached the state of BINGO!!!!</p>
                <p>Here are some guidelines:
                    <ul>
                        <li style="list-style-type:none">
                            <ol>
                                <li>The speaker needs to say the word, so you can prompt them to use a word in the Q&A, but you cannot count you or anyone else saying the word in the Q&A.</li>
                                <li>This game is based on the honor system, so please keep it fun by not cheating.</li>
                                <li>You can only win one prize a day</li>
                                <li>Please tweet a picture of your completed bingo sheet to <a href="https://twitter.com/cwmma">@cwmma</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/guidos">@guidos</a></li>
                                <li>Please mark you sheet with the date as soon as you get it</li>
                                <li>Do not yell BINGO in a talk unless the speaker allows it</li>
                                <li>If you can, please use the following hashtags <strong>#GeoBingo</strong> <strong>#FOSS4G</strong></li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

                <p><a href="https://twitter.com/guidos">My</a> co-worker <a href="https://twitter.com/cwmma">Calvin</a> has started to make event bingo cards for conferences he attends. It's a way to add a little more fun to a conference and because players
                    are waiting for some obscure word in talks, it means that atendees are paying more attention. So we decided to take this idea on the road so we are bringing this to FOSS4G.</p>
                <p>Ok, full discolsure, I am not doing this just out of the kindness of my heart, there is an alterior motive. As co-chair of the <a href="http://2017.foss4g.org">FOSS4G Boston 2017</a> I am using this oppurtunity to spread the good will
                    with the OSGeo community and share some awesome New England prizes. Included in our prises are 2 <a href="http://www.harpoonbrewery.com/">Harpoon Brewery</a> baseball caps, maple sugar candy, and a few really cute plush toys from the
                    <a href="http://www.neaq.org/">New England Aquarium</a>. Finally, Calvin and I work for <a href="http://www.appgeo.com">Applied Geographics</a>, and our company has supported many of our fun projects, including let us print off all
                    the bingo cards on their printer and donating a bunch of bottle openers and Google water bottles. All that said, I did offer to allow anyone one else to offer up prizes, it's about having fun and connecting community... so I hope that
                    this is all ok with you.</p>
                <p>In case you are interested, this game was put together using <a href="https://calvinmetcalf.github.io/bingo/">this open source project</a></p>
