2016 FOSS4G BINGO (unofficial)
**BINGO**
My co-worker Calvin has started to make event bingo cards for conferences he attends. Calvin’s bingo is a game  where you get a sheet with rows and columns filled with random potential words you will hear at an event. Once you have been able to check off that you have heard words across a full column you have achieved bingo. If you have done this before anyone else, then you win a prize.

It looks something like this:

The rules and prizes will be announced by the 20th.

**Please Help**
Please help us build a list of words for FOSS4G Bonn 2016 (unofficial) Bingo by adding a word/phrase related to the conference below: (please keep it clean and try to make it specific… “the” does not count). We will keep filtering the list to help make it clear what ideas are most useful for our process.
